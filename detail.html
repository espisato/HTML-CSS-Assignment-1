        <p>
          We’re rapidly moving towards a day and age where almost everything can
          be controlled by machines and one of the most revolutionary moves has
          been the advent of artificial intelligence. In this
          <a>artificial intelligence course</a>, we will talk about how to get
          started with AI and what exactly it is. While it began as a part of
          smartphones and other smart devices, AI has been increasingly taking
          over in other fields too. To begin with, one must understand what
          Artificial Intelligence is. It is an area of computer science focusing
          on the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like
          humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, of course, there’s a lot more to this simple-seeming definition
          and this phenomenon is surely headed to change the future.
        </p>
        <h5>Goals</h5>
        <p>
          Without us realizing, it has become amply clear that AI has become a
          part of a lot of industries in ways which now seem inseparable. If you
          are trying to
          <a>learn artificial intelligence</a> it is firstly, important to
          understand the goals of AI.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Primary goals: deduction and reasoning, knowledge representation,
            planning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), learning, perception
            and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Long-term goals: To achieve creativity, social intelligence, and
            human level intelligence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is clear as day, that a lot of these goals have been achieved while
          a lot are on the way of being fulfilled. Moreover, the goals that have
          been achieved are surely being refined every day.
        </p>
        <h5>Types</h5>
        <p>
          Next in line with this
          <a>artificial intelligence online course</a>
          is understanding the various types of AI. There are a lot of
          categories that fall into AI but it can be divided into three basic
          concepts based on AI’s capabilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Weak: Weak AI or Narrow AI, perform only one task. The AI has to be
            conditioned with a set of certain answers and roles and it does not
            go beyond that, weak AI is thus not self-sufficient. An example of
            this is iOs’ Siri.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strong: Strong AI can basically do everything that a human being can
            do. Imagine delivering food to people’s doorsteps. A lot of research
            is going into this and engineers have made enough headway into it,
            but there’s still a long way to go.
          </li>
          <li>
            Superintelligence: Artificial superintelligence goes beyond strong
            AI. It can actually exceed human beings when it comes to creativity,
            general wisdom and even social skills.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Core Concepts</h5>
        <p>The core concepts that are currently guiding AI are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Machine Learning: Under machine learning, a machine is fed data
            which it learns to utilize without actually being explicitly
            programmed. The machine automatically recognizes patterns and makes
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning and
            aims to simulate human thinking. The algorithms of this can
            automatically determine the accuracy of a prediction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Supervised Learning: Under supervised learning a machine is fed data
            with labels and categorizations, leading the machine to churn out
            only the same and right answers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unsupervised Learning: With unsupervised learning, on the other
            hand, the machine is fed data without any labels or categories yet
            the machine manages to find patterns and create categories
          </li>
          <li>
            Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm works on trial and error and
            has to be conditioned using reinforcement much like the human mind.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Getting Started</h5>
        <span class="temp">
          Now that you know, the basic concepts and the foundation of AI, it’s
          time to invest your time and resources in a
          <a>programming languages course</a>. There are a lot of languages you
          can start with but many tend to prefer Python.
        </span>
        <span class="temp">
          You can learn Python and take a comprehensive
          <a>artificial intelligence course</a> only on Edyoda, that too for
          free.
