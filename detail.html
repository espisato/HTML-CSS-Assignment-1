        <p>
          We’re rapidly moving towards a day and age where almost everything can
          be controlled by machines and one of the most revolutionary moves has
          been the advent of artificial intelligence. In this artificial
          intelligence course, we will talk about how to get started with AI and
          what exactly it is. While it began as a part of smartphones and other
          smart devices, AI has been increasingly taking over in other fields
          too. To begin with, one must understand what Artificial Intelligence
          is. It is an area of computer science focusing on the creation of
          intelligent machines that work and react like humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, of course, there’s a lot more to this simple-seeming definition
          and this phenomenon is surely headed to change the future.
        </p>
        <h5>Goals</h5>
        <p>
          Without us realizing, it has become amply clear that AI has become a
          part of a lot of industries in ways which now seem inseparable. If you
          are trying to learn artificial intelligence it is firstly, important
          to understand the goals of AI.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Primary goals: deduction and reasoning, knowledge representation,
            planning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), learning, perception
            and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Long-term goals: To achieve creativity, social intelligence, and
            human level intelligence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is clear as day, that a lot of these goals have been achieved while
          a lot are on the way of being fulfilled. Moreover, the goals that have
          been achieved are surely being refined every day.
        </p>
        <h5>Types</h5>
        <p>
          Next in line with this artificial intelligence online course is
          understanding the various types of AI. There are a lot of categories
          that fall into AI but it can be divided into three basic concepts
          based on AI’s capabilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Weak: Weak AI or Narrow AI, perform only one task. The AI has to be
            conditioned with a set of certain answers and roles and it does not
            go beyond that, weak AI is thus not self-sufficient. An example of
            this is iOs’ Siri.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strong: Strong AI can basically do everything that a human being can
            do. Imagine delivering food to people’s doorsteps. A lot of research
            is going into this and engineers have made enough headway into it,
            but there’s still a long way to go.
          </li>
          <li>
            Superintelligence: Artificial superintelligence goes beyond strong
            AI. It can actually exceed human beings when it comes to creativity,
            general wisdom and even social skills.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Core Concepts</h5>
        <p>The core concepts that are currently guiding AI are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Machine Learning: Under machine learning, a machine is fed data
            which it learns to utilize without actually being explicitly
            programmed. The machine automatically recognizes patterns and makes
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning and
            aims to simulate human thinking. The algorithms of this can
            automatically determine the accuracy of a prediction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Supervised Learning: Under supervised learning a machine is fed data
            with labels and categorizations, leading the machine to churn out
            only the same and right answers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unsupervised Learning: With unsupervised learning, on the other
            hand, the machine is fed data without any labels or categories yet
            the machine manages to find patterns and create categories
          </li>
          <li>
            Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm works on trial and error and
            has to be conditioned using reinforcement much like the human mind.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Getting Started</h5>
        <span class="temp">
          Now that you know, the basic concepts and the foundation of AI, it’s
          time to invest your time and resources in a programming languages
          course. There are a lot of languages you can start with but many tend
          to prefer Python.
        </span>
        <span class="temp">
          You can learn Python and take a comprehensive artificial intelligence
          course only on Edyoda, that too for free.
